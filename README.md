# Animal Trading Card

Using CSS to re-create a webpage from a design prototype

The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:
* italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
* bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
* no dots for the animal's list items
* border around the animal's name, image, and information
* border around the animal's information
* spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the propertyÂ padding)
