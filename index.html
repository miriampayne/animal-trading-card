				Otters are carnivors, part of the weasel family, including badgers and minks. The 13 species are aquatic or marine. Collective nouns include romp (descriptive of a playful nature) and, when in water, raft. Their most striking features are the powerful webbed and sharp-clawed feet, as well as seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. The agile skelaton and muscular tail allow for swift turns under water. The thickest fur of any mammal in the animal kingdom, they have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air keeping them dry, warm, and buoyant under water. Otters are rare to glimpse in the wild due to their cautious and secretive nature.
